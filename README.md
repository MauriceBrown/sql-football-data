# European Football Data Analysis using SQL and pandas

This data comes from a [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dimarudov/data-analysis-using-sql/input).

The data is stored in a sqlite database file with the schema defined below. The arrows point in the direction of the *primary* key (i.e. the arrow head *faces* the primary key side of the relationship). A bi-dreictional arrow indicates that the related columns are not the *primary* key in **either** table.
